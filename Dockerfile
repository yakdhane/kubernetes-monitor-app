Sure, here's the Dockerfile code:

```
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Run k8s-monitor.py when the container launches
CMD [ "python", "k8s-monitor.py" ]
```
