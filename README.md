# Kubernetes Realtime Monitor with Streaming Logs

![Kubernetes Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/logo/logo.png)

This is a Python application that monitors Kubernetes pods in real-time and streams their logs. It uses the official Kubernetes Python client library to communicate with the Kubernetes API server.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `kubernetes` Python library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/k8s-monitor.git
   cd k8s-monitor
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, simply execute the `k8s-monitor.py` script:

```bash
python k8s-monitor.py
```

This will start the monitor and stream logs for all running pods in all namespaces.

## Docker

A Dockerfile is included in the repository to build a Docker image of the application.

To build the Docker image, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
docker build -t k8s-monitor .
```

This will build a Docker image with the name `k8s-monitor`.

To run the Docker container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm k8s-monitor
```

This will start the monitor and stream logs for all running pods in all namespaces inside a Docker container.

## Files

- `k8s-monitor.py`: The main Python script that monitors Kubernetes pods and streams their logs.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python libraries required by the application.
- `Dockerfile`: A Dockerfile to build a Docker image of the application.
